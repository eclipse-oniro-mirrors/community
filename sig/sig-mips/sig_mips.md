## SIG group work objectives and scope

### work goals
- Subsystem adaptation commit to master: Enable OpenHarmony to support the MIPS architecture and MIPS devices, provide MIPS software packages and system construction guidance, and maintain support for the MIPS architecture. Adapts to the MIPS instruction set, Clang, Musl, media, graphics, and driver subsystems.
- Upgrade up-to-date version: OpenHarmony is continuously updated to enable continuous evolution and support for MIPS.
- Requirement feedback: Identify the basic capability requirements for OpenHarmony during the adaptation process and incorporate them into the OS version planning.

### work scope

- Focus on the target of 2022, sub-system adaptation of the MIPS architecture commit to master. Complete the adaptation of a MIPS development board (x2000) in the 930 version in 2022.
- Build the capability of OpenHarmony to support the MIPS architecture, and continuously update, adapt, and maintain the OpenHarmony to support the MIPS architecture.
- Adapts the MIPS instruction set, Clang, Musl, media, graphics, and driver subsystems to enable the OpenHarmony to support the MIPS architecture.
- During the adaptation, the basic capability requirements for OpenHarmony are identified and incorporated into the OS version planning.
