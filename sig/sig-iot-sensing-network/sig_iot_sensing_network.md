## SIG group work goals and scope

### work goals

 The IoT Perception Network SIG aims to build the network protocol capabilities necessary for IoT perception scenarios in the 2B industry around OpenHarmony. Based on the OH community, we will cooperate with industry ecological partners to build the technical capabilities of the industry IoT scenario; at the same time, the OH boundary will be expanded to the industry IoT.

### The scope of work

**Building Capability**

SIG construction focuses on the following sub-directions to build Openharmony network stack capabilities:

* **Simplified access**: terminal plug and play, non-inductive access;
* **Secure access**: terminal identity protocol, secure access authentication; terminal type identification; terminal behavior identification;
* **Reliable access**: dual transmission and selective reception, multi-channel, redundant coding;
* **Communication enhancement**: encrypted transmission, IoT communication quality perception;
**Edge Intelligence:**Data compression, data analysis, data distribution, etc.

**Building Ecology**

* **Identify Pain Points**: Go deep into business scenarios to identify scenario pain points and opportunities; currently, it has penetrated into 6 major industry IoT scenarios (medical, transportation, water conservancy, energy, education, manufacturing, etc.).
* **Partnerships**: Join hands with capable eco-partners to incubate innovative scenario capabilities for IoT scenarios in the industry. Currently there are 200+ partners;

**Setting standards**

 Hold high, cooperate with leading customers in the industry, and start from corporate standards, industry standards, and national standards to promote OS autonomy and controllability, IoT capability building requirements, and build OpenHarmony’s moat

**Wide copy**

* Based on the understanding of industry solutions, build the industrial influence of the IoT scene in the OH industry, and build the OH brand. Realize the mutual promotion of OH and projects.
