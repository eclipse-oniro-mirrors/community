## Objectives and Scope

### Objectives

The driver SIG is responsible for building a unified Hardware Driver Foundation (HDF) for OpenHarmony to deploy driver software on devices of different sizes and continuously improve the development efficiency of drivers. The HDF provides a hardware driver platform with kernel decoupling, elastic framework, component-based device model, and unified configuration interface.

### Work Scope

- Define and design the device driver framework and guard its development and evolution.
- Review the Hardware Device Interface (HDI) APIs.
- Organize regular meetings on device drivers, and plan technical communication, Q&A, and sharing.
- Actively work with developers to promote the device ecosystem construction and expansion for device drivers in OpenHarmony projects.

> The code of the HDF driver management framework components and driver components can be built on a mini-, small-, or standard-system device. In a standard-system device, you can also specify the user mode or kernel mode for the build.
