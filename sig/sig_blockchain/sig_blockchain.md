## SIG group work objectives and scope

### Work Objectives
Oriented to the needs of integrating OpenHarmony OS, IoT devices and blockchain, the group aims to build a universal, blockchain-oriented, and user-friendly OS, “Blockchain of Things(BoT)-OpenHarmony OS”. The OS would fulfill users’ needs of data-preservation, device-security, and privacy protection. It would be the trust foundation of the digital world, which aggregates data from IoT devices and interlaces on blockchain, to build an ecosystem of BoT in scenarios such as carbon-neutral, smart-city, smart-community, etc. 

### Work Scope
- Native support of uploading data to blockchain through OpenHarmony

The group would develop a component to add native support of uploading data through OpenHarmony so that the users of OpenHarmony could interact with blockchain in an easy way.

- Establishing Sample Project

The group would establish sample projects on “IoT + Blockchain” as reference of feasibility to other interested parties. 

- Expanding Ecosystems

The group would actively seek cooperation with IoT device manufactures to promote the prosperity of the ecology of BoT with OpenHarmony OS. Especially, the group would explore the application of OpenHarmony and Blockchain in the scenario of carbon neutral.
