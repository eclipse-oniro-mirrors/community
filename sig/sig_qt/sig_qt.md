## SIG Group Work Objectives and Scope

### Work Goals

The Qt SIG is responsible for porting and adapting the [Qt](https://qt.io) software development framework to OpenHarmony. It aims to facilitate the migration of applications developed based on Qt and supplement the development ecosystem of OpenHarmony. The adapted Qt code for the OpenHarmony platform will be submitted to the Qt community.

### Work Scope

The Qt framework porting and adaptation plan contributes to versions Qt5.12.12 and Qt5.15.11.

The adaptation contribution plan for version Qt5.12.12 is as follows:
