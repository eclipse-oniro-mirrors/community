## SIG group work objectives and scope

### work goals

- Enable OpenHarmony to support LongArch architecture and LongArch equipment, and provide guidance on LongArch software package and system construction.
- Maintain support for LongArch architecture; Including the adaptation of LongArch instruction set, Clang, Musl, media, graphics, driver and other subsystems.
- Realize that LoongArch chip (2K0500/2K1000LA/2K1500/2K2000, etc.) is compatible with OpenHarmony small system and standard system.
- Realize that LoongArch supports OpenHarmony's relevant code to be open source and on the trunk, and maintain relevant code continuously.
- Support Arkruntime's adaptation to Godson command set.


### work scope

- Focusing on the LoongArch architecture chip platform for the embedded field, mainly the No. 2 series, including 2K0500, 2K1000LA, 2K1500, 2K2000 and other chips.
- By 2022, the LoongArch architecture chip (2K0500/2K1000LA) will be adapted to small systems.
- In 2023, the subsystem based on the LoongArch architecture will be adapted to the backbone of the round, and the LoongArch architecture chip (2K0500/2K1000LA) will be adapted to the small system and put on the backbone.
- In 2023, we will focus on the LoongArch architecture chip (2K1000LA/2K2000) to adapt to the standard system, and at the same time, the relevant code will be on the backbone.
- Build the ability of OpenHarmony to support the LongArch architecture, and constantly update, adapt, and maintain the OpenHarmony related code to enable the supported LongArch architecture.
- The adaptation of LongArch architecture, Clang, Musl, media, graphics, driver and other subsystems enables OpenHarmony to support LongArch architecture.
- Realize the support of LongArch architecture for Arkruntime and other services, and open up the north-oriented application framework.
- Support Arkruntime's adaptation to Godson command set.
