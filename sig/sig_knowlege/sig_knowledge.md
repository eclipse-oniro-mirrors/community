## SIG group work objectives and scope

### work goals
​	Based on the released version of sample/codelabs, evolve more scenario demos that developers can refer to directly, and developer sample packages are regularly formed based on these scenario demos. Create a complete openharmony knowledge system and promote it to the majority of developers, make OpenHarmony capabilities explicit, so that developers can see more possibilities, so as to achieve the purpose of promoting OpenHarmony. For example, according to distributed and multi device coordination, we advanced the concept of distributed schedule, so that smart devices at home can work together in the form of schedule arrangement. Especially for the scenes where the elderly, children and pets are at home alone and unattended, we build a set of "mobile phone + service + device" framework and platform to enable linkage between mobile phones, watches and smart home devices. We also cooperated with many developers to create their own "super terminal" scenario demo.

### work scope

- Output the scenario demo based on the release version of sample/codelabs

- Output detailed development instructions and courses for the developed scenario demo

- Based on scenario demos, put forward relevant evolution topics to allow developers to participate in building their own OpenHarmony devices and applications
