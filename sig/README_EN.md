OpenHarmony Community SIG Governance
====================================
English | [简体中文](./README.md)


This document outlines the governance system for Special Interest Groups (SIGs) in the OpenHarmony community, including the application, operation, modification, and termination of SIGs.

A. Applying for a New SIG
--------------------------

### 1. Preparation for Application

   *   Developers should carefully read the [SIG Governance Document](../zh/sig_governance.md) to understand the operational rules of SIGs in the OpenHarmony community. They should also prepare documents such as the SIG Charter and SIG Bylaws.
   *   SIG applicants need to ensure the uniqueness and feasibility of their technical direction:
   *   Each SIG in the OpenHarmony community has a different technical focus. If the proposed application falls within an existing technical area, it is recommended to participate in the relevant SIG instead.
   *   Developers can review the [existing SIG list](https://gitee.com/openharmony/community/tree/master/sig) in the OpenHarmony community and check the [historical DEV mailing list](https://lists.openatom.io/hyperkitty/list/dev@openharmony.io/) to confirm that there are no ongoing or planned SIGs with the same technical focus.
   *   The technical project proposed for establishing a SIG should eventually translate into a new component of OpenHarmony.
   *   If developers have any doubts about the technical direction after reviewing the relevant information, they can consult the PMC via the mailing list [dev@openharmony.io](mailto:dev@openharmony.io).

### 2. Submitting the Application

   *   SIG initiators need to create an initial draft of the SIG proposal following the [SIG Charter Template](../meeting-notes/docs/openharmony_sig_template.pptx) and complete the [application process](../zh/sig_governance.md).

### 3. PMC Approval of the Proposal

   *   SIG initiators can submit the new SIG proposal during a regular PMC meeting and present the details of the proposed SIG. The PMC will review and approve the establishment of the SIG, including the creation of relevant SIG repositories and communication channels.
   *   A meeting summary will be created, including the PMC's approval comments.

### 4. Creating the SIG Group

   *   After receiving the PMC's feedback and confirmation of the approved SIG proposal, the SIG initiator should proceed as follows:
   *   Follow the [creation process](../zh/sig_governance.md) to create the SIG group.

B. SIG Operation
-----------------

### (A) SIG RepositAories and Communication Channels

1.  SIGs should utilize the unified infrastructure provided by the OpenHarmony community for work and communication, including Gitee repositories and mailing lists.
2.  For the process of repository creation, renaming, or exiting, please refer to the [operational process](../zh/sig_governance.md).
3.  The person responsible for the SIG mailing list can contact **[xzmu@openatom.org](mailto:xzmu@openatom.org)** to create the mailing list:
    *   Provide detailed information on the mailing list name and the administrator's email address (usually the SIG leader).
    *   Once the mailing list is successfully created:
4.  The SIG leader should ensure the effective operation of SIG repositories and communication channels, promptly responding to members' questions and feedback.
    

### (B) SIG Meetings

1.  SIGs should hold regular meetings to facilitate communication and collaboration among members. Meetings can be conducted online or offline, depending on the geographical locations and feasibility for participants.
2.  The meeting convener should notify the members in advance of the meeting time, location (if offline), and agenda. Notifications can be sent through mailing lists, community forums, or other appropriate communication channels.
3.  The meeting agenda should include progress reports, discussions on important topics, decision-making, and other relevant discussions. Meeting minutes should capture the key points, discussion outcomes, and decisions made during the meeting, and should be shared with SIG members in a timely manner.

### (C) SIG Management

1.  The SIG leader is responsible for ensuring the normal operation and management of the SIG, as well as maintaining communication and coordination with the PMC.
2.  The SIG leader has the authority to determine the work direction, task assignments, and membership of the SIG.
3.  The SIG leader should regularly report the progress and achievements of the SIG to the PMC and the community members.
4.  The SIG leader can organize working groups or task groups as needed to coordinate the work of the members and advance the goals of the SIG.
5.  If necessary, the SIG leader can submit requests for changes or termination of the SIG to the PMC, providing sufficient reasons and explanations.

C. SIG Modification and Termination
------------------------------------

1.  SIG modification includes changes in SIG leadership, adjustments in the work direction, and reassignment of tasks. The SIG leader should promptly inform the PMC and SIG members, and the changes should be determined through consultation and discussion.
2.  If there is a need to terminate a SIG, the SIG leader should submit a termination request to the PMC, along with sufficient reasons and explanations. The PMC will assess and decide on the termination of the SIG based on the circumstances.
