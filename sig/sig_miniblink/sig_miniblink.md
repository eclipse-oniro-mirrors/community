## SIG group work objectives and scope

### work goals

1. Develop a system level common rendering component, which can provide two sets of interfaces, one for the system itself and the other for app
2. According to the multi platform and multi kernel characteristics of openharmony, different levels of rendering capabilities are provided, including:
   * Switching between different JS engines
   * Different H5 standards support
   * Support for different expansion capabilities (basic rendering, webgl, webrtc, audio and video, etc.)
   * Other application scenario adaptation

### work scope
1. Regularly publish technical analysis articles to share core code writing skills, algorithms, architecture design, etc

2. Based on the unit test code, it is separately packaged into a gadget or small SDK library, which is free for community developers

3. Regularly answer questions for netizens or jointly discuss rendering kernel related technologies

4. Publish a series of demos of different application scenarios based on MB, such as interface library, crawler library, general login module, general payment component, etc

5. Discussion on H5 standard

6. Edit relevant books. At present, there is no book about blink on the market. It is planned to write two books, one for the kernel and one for front-end developers on how to optimize JS
